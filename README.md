# Language-translation-with-RNN

## Project Overview

This project is PROJECT 4 of my Deep learning class at UDACITY. In this project, I built A deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. My completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

Machine translation is the task of automatically converting source text in one language to text in another language. In a machine translation task, the input already consists of a sequence of symbols in some language, and the computer program must convert this into a sequence of symbols in another language.

## Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Udacity Workspaces (Recommended)

Udacity Workspaces provide remote connection to GPU-enabled instances right from the classroom. Refer to the classroom lesson for this project to find an overview of navigating & using Jupyter notebook Workspaces.

## Google COlab(Optional)

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

> - Zero configuration required
> - Free access to GPUs
> - Easy sharing

## Install

> - Python 3
> - NumPy
> - TensorFlow 1.x
> - Keras 2.x
